# Feature Specification: Paragraph Reformatter Modelfile

**Feature Branch**: `001-paragraph-reformatter`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a new Modelfile, Modelfile-reformat, that simply and cleanly breaks its input into well structured paragraphs"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Process Raw Transcript Text (Priority: P1)

Users need to transform unstructured text output from speech-to-text transcription into well-organized paragraphs that are easier to read and understand.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - taking poorly formatted text and making it readable. Without this, the feature provides no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a block of unformatted text to the reformatter and verifying the output contains proper paragraph breaks and improved structure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a block of continuous text with no paragraph breaks, **When** the user processes it through the reformatter, **Then** the output contains logical paragraph breaks based on topic shifts and natural breaks in content
2. **Given** text with run-on sentences spanning multiple ideas, **When** the user applies the reformatter, **Then** the output groups related ideas together into coherent paragraphs

### User Story 2 - Handle Various Text Lengths (Priority: P2)

Users need to process text of varying lengths from short notes to lengthy transcripts without degradation in quality or performance.

**Why this priority**: Real-world usage will involve diverse content lengths. The tool must handle this variety to be broadly useful.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by processing texts of different lengths (50 words, 500 words, 5000 words) and verifying consistent paragraph structure quality across all inputs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a short text snippet under 100 words, **When** processed by the reformatter, **Then** appropriate paragraph structure is applied without over-segmentation
2. **Given** a long transcript over 2000 words, **When** processed by the reformatter, **Then** the text is broken into multiple well-structured paragraphs that maintain topic coherence

---

### User Story 3 - Preserve Original Meaning (Priority: P1)

Users need the reformatter to improve structure without altering, removing, or adding content beyond formatting improvements.

**Why this priority**: Content integrity is critical - users must trust that their original meaning and words remain intact.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing word-for-word content before and after processing, verifying no additions, deletions, or substantive changes occurred beyond paragraph structuring.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** input text with specific technical terms or names, **When** processed by the reformatter, **Then** all original terms and names are preserved exactly
2. **Given** input text with specific facts or numbers, **When** reformatted, **Then** all factual content remains unchanged

### Edge Cases

- What happens when input text is already well-formatted with proper paragraphs?
- How does the system handle text with mixed languages or special characters?
- What happens with extremely short inputs (single sentences)?
- How are line breaks and whitespace in the original text handled?
- What happens with text containing markdown, code blocks, or other formatting?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept text input of any reasonable length (up to typical transcript lengths of ~10,000 words)
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify logical topic boundaries and sentence groupings to determine paragraph breaks
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve all original content without additions, deletions, or word changes
- **FR-004**: System MUST output text with clear paragraph separation (standard double line breaks between paragraphs)
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle text that contains numbers, special characters, and punctuation correctly
- **FR-006**: System MUST process text without requiring specific input formatting or preprocessing
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the original sequence and order of content

### Key Entities

- **Input Text**: The raw, unformatted text provided by the user, typically from speech-to-text transcription output
- **Reformatted Text**: The output text with improved paragraph structure, maintaining all original content but with logical paragraph breaks applied

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully process a typical transcript (500-2000 words) and receive properly paragraphed output in under 30 seconds
- **SC-002**: 95% of processed outputs contain appropriate paragraph breaks with 3-8 sentences per paragraph on average
- **SC-003**: 100% of original text content is preserved in the output (word-for-word accuracy excluding whitespace formatting)
- **SC-004**: Users report improved readability compared to the original unformatted text in subjective assessment
