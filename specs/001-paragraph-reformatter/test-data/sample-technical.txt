Welcome to this technical discussion about API design and implementation. The application uses RESTful endpoints at https://api.example.com/v1/users for user management. You can retrieve user data by calling GET /users/{id} which returns JSON formatted responses. The authentication system relies on JWT tokens with RS256 signatures. Each token has a 3600-second expiration time and includes claims like sub user_id and iat. The implementation uses the jose library version 3.2.1 for token validation. Here's a code snippet showing the basic structure: ```python
def validate_token(token):
    verifier = RSAVerifier(public_key)
    claims = verifier.verify(token)
    return claims['sub']
```

The database schema includes three primary tables. The users table has columns id, username, email, created_at, and updated_at. Foreign key relationships connect to the profiles table via users.id = profiles.user_id. The system stores timestamps in UTC format following ISO 8601 standards like 2025-10-16T14:30:00Z. All monetary values use the DECIMAL(10,2) data type to avoid floating point precision issues. The API rate limit is 100 requests per minute per API key. Error responses follow RFC 7807 Problem Details format with application/problem+json content type. WebSocket connections use the wss://ws.example.com endpoint for real-time updates. The deployment pipeline uses Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes with helm charts stored in the infrastructure/k8s/ directory.
